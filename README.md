## 📌 Project Description
As part of my Python Development Internship at Codveda Technologies, I developed multiple Python applications to strengthen my programming and problem-solving skills.  

The projects include a **To-Do List Application** for task management and an **API Integration project** that fetches real-time weather data using an external API.  

These projects demonstrate my understanding of Python fundamentals, data structures, file handling, API communication, and real-world application development.
